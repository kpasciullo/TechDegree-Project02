    <section class="skills">
   
    <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>HTML is the most used markup language, and CSS is responsible for a website's layout and design. I have been working with 
            both of these web languages for many years and am very confident using them to create webpages. I used them 
            both to create this very page.
        </p>
        </section>

    <section class="skills">
    <h3>Analytical Skills</h3>
        <p>I have a natural analytical instinct. I am always considering the functionality of what I am creating as well as the needs of my client.
            I make sure that every step of the way I am merging performace and requirements to create the best product possible. 
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="skills">
    <h3>Responsive Design Skills</h3>
    <p>I understand how responsive design works, I know that today mobile devices account for approximately half of all web traffic.
        I create websites that respond to a changing screen size. This webpage was created with a mobile first design, then customized to
        fit medium (tablet) screens and large (desktop) screens. If you are using a device that allows it you can change the size of your 
        browser to see how this page will respond and change to a more functional layout depending on the size. 
    </p>
    </section>
    <section class="skills">
        <h3>Testing and Debugging Skills</h3>
        <p>I take pride in writing well designed, efficient code, testing my work is an important part of this. I continually test webpages for
            possible errors, and if any problems should arise I correct them immediately. Testing is making sure that my code is doing what it 
            is supposed to do, and being able to consistently test and debug my webpages is essential. 
        </p>
